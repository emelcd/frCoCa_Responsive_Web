            English scientist <strong>Alan Turing</strong> was born Alan
            Mathison Turing on June 23, 1912, in Maida Vale, London, England. At
            a young age, he displayed signs of high intelligence, which some of
            his teachers recognized, but did not necessarily respect. When
            Turing attended the well-known independent Sherborne School at the
            age of 13, he became particularly interested in math and science.

            In 1936, Turing delivered a paper, "On Computable Numbers, with an
            Application to the Entscheidungsproblem," in which he presented the
            notion of a universal machine (later called the ‚ÄúUniversal Turing
            Machine," and then the "Turing machine") capable of computing
            anything that is computable: It is considered the precursor to the
            modern computer.

            During World War II, Turing was a leading participant in wartime
            code-breaking, particularly that of German ciphers. He worked at
            Bletchley Park, the GCCS wartime station, where he made five major
            advances in the field of cryptanalysis, including specifying the
            bombe, an electromechanical device used to help decipher German
            Enigma encrypted signals.

            Homosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom in the early 1950s,
            so when Turing admitted to police, called to his house after a
            January 1952 break-in, that he'd had a sexual relationship with the
            perpetrator, 19-year-old Arnold Murray, he was charged with gross
            indecency. Following his arrest, Turing was forced to choose between
            temporary probation on the condition that he receive hormonal
            treatment for libido reduction, or imprisonment. He chose the
            former, and soon underwent chemical castration through injections of
            a synthetic estrogen hormone for a year, which eventually rendered
            him impotent.
